1) Deleted Alien.Counter Movement
testing
2) Repositioned Flag_Gameover = False
3) Added the Flag_Level part 
4) Adding the Flag_Level display at the very end of the menu
5) Added the Function of level draw 
6) changed the for i to 31 for the score drawing before level draw
7) changed the alien layout to layout level 1, level2, and level 3
8) moved the alien layout part to alien refill and the alien layout is different now
9) changed the iteration for the aliens through a variety of complicated steps.
	1) I deleted the all the Alien.Counter_Movement to see what happens
	2) I changed the layout for the aliens to only 2-D lists instaed of 3-D lists
	3) I reverted how the aliens are filled by different ways by removing alien grou pand xpos
		a) I removed alien_group
            b) I changed the group iteration to column iteration 
            c) I changed the group* to the column*30
            d) I removed xpos counter
      4) I changed how the aliens are iterated in player bullets check through a variety of steps
            a) I changed the iteration strategy to directly aliens
            b) instead of group.remove(aliens), I did aliens.remove(alien)
            c) I dedented everything
            d) I removed the counter movement variable position in iteration of no use
      5) I changed how the aliens are iterated as all of them moving at the same time through a varity of steps
            a) I changed the alien timer to 40
            b) I used two for loops instead of the following lines of code in case for future importnat ref erence


                    if Alien.Flag_Down_Step == True:
                        for i in range(len(aliens[])):
                            aliens[][i].Move_Down()
                            aliens[][i].Shoot()
                            aliens[][i].Check()
                    for i in range(len(aliens[])):
                        aliens[][i].Move_Alien()
                        aliens[][i].Shoot()
                        aliens[][i].Check()
                     =  + 1
            I also deleted the following lines of code form no use
              
        ## checking if all the aliens have moved
            if  == len(aliens):
                
            ## stoping the aliens from continously moving down
                if Alien.Flag_Collide_Side != None and Alien.Flag_Down_Step == True:
                    Alien.Flag_Down_Step = False
                    Alien.Flag_Collide_Side = None

            ## enabling the aliens to move down
                if Alien.Flag_Collide_Side != None:
                    Alien.Flag_Down_Step = True
      6) I changed how the aliens are drawn either in the screen draw and in the game by directly iterationg through the aliens
      7) I changed how the background music is played
      Bug Stop it the aliens are continuously moving down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]
	8) In order to fix it, I changed the alien xpos gap from 20 to 100 (To be changed)
      Bug The aliens still continuously move down
      9) In order to fix it, I made sure that the aliens.Flag_Collide Side reverts back to none after moving down
          printedthe aliens' xpos)
      10) I also changed the place where the alien's xpos is checked to hit a certain cordinate to avoid being checked at unncessary times
      11) I made sure that the alien dies directly and removes from the alien list when the player bullets hit them
      12) To the exciting part!!!
      13) I checked if the alien type is greater then zero and placed the alien on the screen based on the type as a 1 is equivalent to a small alien adn
      14) I made modifications to the alien images that includes different sizes for the different level of boss aliens 
      15) I made sure that the size of the alien will be determined by it's attributes giving it a self variable and drawing it based on it's szie
      16) I had the make the modifications for the start aliens and also the display aliens
      17) The alien's length and width are determined by it's size
      19) I added the health for the aliens and that the health will dimish by one for every time the player bullet hits the aliens and that the alien                  
          explosion only gets added to the alien when it disappears from the screen and that the player earns points only when the alien disappears from 	    the screen by repositioning various elements
      18) I added the function that made the alien split
      19) I repositioned whent the game destroys the alien and when the alien explosion gets placed inside the alien split function
      20) I made sure that the alien explosion doesn't do a sound anymore and that it is from the class for the player bullet
      21) I upgraded the code so that the alien gets updated whenever it becomes shot including it's health it's splitting, and it's 
          dissapearing 
      22) I deupgraded the alien so that it's health is decreased manually, and whenever it's health reaches zero, that's when the functions take place.
          I also made sure that is the cause because the player's score only updates when it's health decreases to zero
       Time for the ULTRA FUN AND EXCITING LEVEL PART
      23) This is the time when I began to add levels to the game. For level 3, I added a few big aliens
      24) I made the scalefactor for more TREMEMDOUS FUN positioning of the aliens and loaded the aliens based on the x and y scale factor. The aliens now
          looks like a giant ship
      25) I updated the scale factor a little bit by making the size and the dimentions different from it creating many bugs. I also made sure that when
 the size is one, the size multipler is 1 using the recursive property
      26) I made the entire alien class have only one animation so that when I load new aliens, it will match all the other aliens
      27) That just cause the entire alien class system to crash and the aliens do not change animation anymore. I instead only changed animations after all the aliens have moved
      28) I uploaded all the alien images differently in a more structured and more organized manner having checked 3 times
      29) I upgraded the code so that I first transformed the image before appending the image into a list. I edited if self.size > 1 for splitting from	    if self.size != 1
      30) I upgraded the alien's health to increase exponentially
      31) I upgraded the timer so the timer is shorter as this makes the game a little more difficult
      32) I made the alien timer 30 now and I also made the bigger aliens move bigger steps then the smaller aliens
      33) I made all the aliens move the same steps because previously, it was so difficult to arrange levels, and I also made a level with a big alien
          comprised of many small aliens
      34) I made sure to add the level every time the aliens refill and that it is equal to zero every time that the level restarts again.
      35) I added the yshift to the aliens so they know where to start by making it originally 120
      36) I removed the aspect where the aliens move downwards after each level by removing every area where the alien counter position is
      37) I made sure that the aliens are positioned out directly towards the alien x distance and the alien y distance fromt he alein x factor * 15 and 
          the alien y factor * 15 
      38) I made sure that the aliens do not have a backup xpos anymore of 100 pixels
      39) I increased it to 60 pixels so the aliens don't jump down uncessarily
          
a 2 is equivalent to a big alien
