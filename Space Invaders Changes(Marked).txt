1) Deleted Alien.Counter Movement
2) Repositioned Flag_Gameover = False
3) Added the Flag_Level part 
4) Adding the Flag_Level display at the very end of the menu
5) Added the Function of level draw 
6) changed the for i to 31 for the score drawing before level draw
7) changed the alien layout to layout level 1, level2, and level 3
8) moved the alien layout part to alien refill and the alien layout is different now
9) changed the iteration for the aliens through a variety of complicated steps.
	1) I deleted the all the Alien.Counter_Movement to see what happens
	2) I changed the layout for the aliens to only 2-D lists instaed of 3-D lists
	3) I reverted how the aliens are filled by different ways by removing alien grou pand xpos
		a) I removed alien_group
            b) I changed the group iteration to column iteration 
            c) I changed the group* to the column*30
            d) I removed xpos counter
      4) I changed how the aliens are iterated in player bullets check through a variety of steps
            a) I changed the iteration strategy to directly aliens
            b) instead of group.remove(aliens), I did aliens.remove(alien)
            c) I dedented everything
            d) I removed the counter movement variable position in iteration of no use
      5) I changed how the aliens are iterated as all of them moving at the same time through a varity of steps
            a) I changed the alien timer to 40
            b) I used two for loops instead of the following lines of code in case for future importnat ref erence


                    if Alien.Flag_Down_Step == True:
                        for i in range(len(aliens[])):
                            aliens[][i].Move_Down()
                            aliens[][i].Shoot()
                            aliens[][i].Check()
                    for i in range(len(aliens[])):
                        aliens[][i].Move_Alien()
                        aliens[][i].Shoot()
                        aliens[][i].Check()
                     =  + 1
            I also deleted the following lines of code form no use
              
        ## checking if all the aliens have moved
            if  == len(aliens):
                
            ## stoping the aliens from continously moving down
                if Alien.Flag_Collide_Side != None and Alien.Flag_Down_Step == True:
                    Alien.Flag_Down_Step = False
                    Alien.Flag_Collide_Side = None

            ## enabling the aliens to move down
                if Alien.Flag_Collide_Side != None:
                    Alien.Flag_Down_Step = True
      6) I changed how the aliens are drawn either in the screen draw and in the game by directly iterationg through the aliens
      7) I changed how the background music is played
      Bug Stop it the aliens are continuously moving down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]
	8) In order to fix it, I changed the alien xpos gap from 20 to 100 (To be changed)
      Bug The aliens still continuously move down
      9) In order to fix it, I made sure that the aliens.Flag_Collide Side reverts back to none after moving down
          printedthe aliens' xpos)
      10) I also changed the place where the alien's xpos is checked to hit a certain cordinate to avoid being checked at unncessary times
      11) I made sure that the alien dies directly and removes from the alien list when the player bullets hit them
      12) To the exciting part!!!
      13) I checked if the alien type is greater then zero and placed the alien on the screen based on the type as a 1 is equivalent to a small alien adn
      14) I made modifications to the alien images that includes different sizes for the different level of boss aliens 
      15) I made sure that the size of the alien will be determined by it's attributes giving it a self variable and drawing it based on it's szie
      16) I had the make the modifications for the start aliens and also the display aliens
      17) The alien's length and width are determined by it's size
      19) I added the health for the aliens and that the health will dimish by one for every time the player bullet hits the aliens and that the alien                  
          explosion only gets added to the alien when it disappears from the screen and that the player earns points only when the alien disappears from 	    the screen by repositioning various elements
      18) I added the function that made the alien split
      19) I repositioned whent the game destroys the alien and when the alien explosion gets placed inside the alien split function
      20) I made sure that the alien explosion doesn't do a sound anymore and that it is from the class for the player bullet
      21) I upgraded the code so that the alien gets updated whenever it becomes shot including it's health it's splitting, and it's 
          dissapearing 
      22) I deupgraded the alien so that it's health is decreased manually, and whenever it's health reaches zero, that's when the functions take place.
          I also made sure that is the cause because the player's score only updates when it's health decreases to zero
       Time for the ULTRA FUN AND EXCITING LEVEL PART
      23) did This is the time when I began to add levels to the game. For level 3, I added a few big aliens didasdfjasldfja;lksdfja;lsdjf;asdjf;la
      24) did I made the scalefactor for more TREMEMDOUS FUN positioning of the aliens and loaded the aliens based on the x and y scale factor. The aliens now
          looks like a giant ship
      25) did I updated the scale factor a little bit by making the size and the dimentions different from it creating many bugs. I also made sure that when
 the size is one, the size multipler is 1 using the recursive property
      26) did I made the entire alien class have only one animation so that when I load new aliens, it will match all the other aliens
      27) did  That just cause the entire alien class system to crash and the aliens do not change animation anymore. I instead only changed animations after all the aliens have moved
      28) did I uploaded all the alien images differently in a more structured and more organized manner having checked 3 times
      29)did  I upgraded the code so that I first transformed the image before appending the image into a list. I edited if self.size > 1 for splitting from	    if self.size != 1
      30) did I upgraded the alien's health to increase exponentially
      31) did I upgraded the timer so the timer is shorter as this makes the game a little more difficult
      32) did I made the alien timer 30 now and I also made the bigger aliens move bigger steps then the smaller aliens
      33)did  I made all the aliens move the same steps because previously, it was so difficult to arrange levels, and I also made a level with a big alien
          did comprised of many small aliens
      34) did I made sure to add the level every time the aliens refill and that it is equal to zero every time that the level restarts again.
      35) did I added the yshift to the aliens so they know where to start by making it originally 120 and also added the xshift originally at 100
      36) did I removed the aspect where the aliens move downwards after each level by removing every area where the alien counter position is
      37)  did I made sure that the aliens are positioned out directly towards the alien x distance and the alien y distance fromt he alein x factor * 15 and 
          did the alien y factor * 15 
      38) did I made sure that the aliens do not have a backup xpos anymore of 100 pixels
      39) did I increased it to 60 pixels so the aliens don't jump down uncessarily
      40) did I made sure that the aliens shoot down at me or aim at me
      advice
      41) I added a monster and a dodge bullet 
      42) did I removed the player bullet in a different area to avoid the aspect where the player's score increases and removes only after checking if it is in player bullets and in the if conditions to incrase the score
      43) did I made the aliens add an alien bullet in the right sport
<<<<<<< HEAD
      44) did I added a function to decipher how many aliens on the screen and how many shots neeeded as each level goes up
      45) did I made sure to level draw after every level. 
    
          
a 2 is equivalent to a big alien

1) Plan: I am now trying to match up the code so both of them is equal and am iterating through the entire process and next time if I make any changes to one code, I will also make to the other for the better. 
I am now currently in the class of the alien class 

## after a long time in coding, these steps are far past the errors prior and I am just trying
to correct everything with no bugs

1) I updated the commentary that writes to draw the alien before 
actually drawing the alien
2) I added in space invaders 2 a function called change animation but it was uncessary so I deleted it
instead, I changed it so that the alien changes animation whenever it moves
3) I also made sure that whenever I drew the alien, I would draw the self animation not the class animation
4) I made sure to delete the periodic alien class variable and localized it instead similar to the original game
6) Scrap! I scrapped 1,2,3,and 4. 
7) I made sure to create a function to change the alien's animation
8) I made sure to change the self.Animation only when it is a start alien
by usign parameters
9) I added all the parameters the start alien movements as true
10) I made sure to call the function changing the alien's animation for the game aliens
11) I repositioned the area where the alien's length and flag collide
side is checked wheneer it is moved
12) I added commentary for the alien move down function and the change animation function
13) I made sure to avoid any spacing for the function call and the next line.

## now, I will try to add a new level that has unlimited amount of aliens
1) In order to do this, I will have to generate the cordinates for a new level
2) I created a function in the alien class that generates 10 more aliens when the aliens
in the original layout gets down
3) I changed the name of the function to copy alien and I called it if the level is 14
and the alien is moving down 
4) I made sure to move the mystery ship upwards 
Check to make sure the position is right, I made the xpos for it 400 and will change it back
5) I found that the right xpos is 40
6) I made sure to change the mystery ship's xpos back to 2500 from 
7) I backspaced the Move Alien Bullet funciton in the original space invaders game
8) I made sure to print 'here' in the copy alien function
9) There is a bug where the aliens stop moving and the game crashes
10) I made sure to stop that by nonlocalizing the flag game variable
11) The bug is still there
12) I decided to print the length of the aliens both in the function and in the game
13) I decided to stop printing the length of the aliens in the middle of the game and instead utilize the function
for printing the aliens in the function with a pause
14) I found that the results were that the aliens kept getting bigger without stopping so I 
15) I finally realized that with the new aliens, they were never iterated through so I made sure
to add new aliens only when the aliens already moved down 
16) I deleted everything
17) I changed how to add the new aliens to the lists in order to make it better
18) I changed my mind now!
19) I continued the plan to fill the aliens
20) I only did it with certain if conditions
21) I created the if condition of level 14 outside
22) I added level 15
23) I added the upper range as an iteration upper range based on the length of the aliens
24) I made sure to generate then with the number 3 as the type
25) I made sure to add a message for level 14 and level 15
26) I added spacing to the bullet draws for the aliens
27) I added messages showing the audience the new levels
28) I increased the fill black screen by a large 

29) Remember to check if the code is organized from steps 23 - 28
30) This is the time where I am going to start to change the class Words And phrases
    a) I began making the phrase a list of the prhase
    b) I made sure when iterating througn the phrase:
        I checked for various symbols
    c) I canceled listing the phrase for string operation
    d) I made all the numbers strings instead including the left, right, equal, asterisk, question_mark, dash, and space
    e) It came with a few exceptions of the yflip
    f) I ran into many errors. The first one was the key error of '1'
    g) To solve it, I made sure that the words and phrases class doesn't have any more string intergars
    but regular integars which transform the string integar to a regular integar
        g.1) I also frogot to get rid of the usless 'Space' in the character name lists
        g.2) I also made sure to first transform the image before storing it to the list
        g.3) I also updated the pause letter draw to close function
        g.4) I upgraded it so I don't have to have the character image list anymore
    f) suprisingly, it already worked. I am just going to have to check it many times to make sure it is organized
    g) I will also have to add it to the original space invaders gam
    h) Time for the fun part. 
    I) I managed to get rid of all the message list and put it directly as the message
    J) I need to do that for both programs of code
    K) I made sure to pause the drawing of the letters by a tenth of a second or 6 60th of a second
    L) I made sure to only pause the computer for 2 seconds with level draw
    M) I ridded the white box that used to surround it, and also changed the sentences
    N) Now, I just have to make sure that both of the codes are secure
    O) I updated the game so that the there is no more yflip issue
    P) There was also a bug in the original space invaders game. I had to add the sound to it as well.
    Q) I changed all the words and pahrases for the space invaders original 
    R) I also changed the pause time with the words and phrases so it is measured in 60 parts per second pause 
31) For space invaders 2, I decided to 
32) I also updated the matrix for the space invaders 2 game so that it became a little smaller
33) I am now planning to add a message for the space invaders 2 game after level 15
    a) to do that, I started with an iteration strategy that I iterate the lines and read them
    b) I also made sure to add the actual text for the level 15 and also the periods
    c) I frogot to also make sure that the text in space invaders 2 don't overlap
    d) I also added the period sign to the words and phrases
    e) I also made sure that the game pauses for a little while while drawing the alien's characters
    f) I had to change the text many times before I am satisfied with the writing of it

## middle function
        def middle(phrase):
            a = 480 - len(phrase)*15
            print(a/2)   
    
    g) I also added only type 3 aliens for levels greater then 15
    h) I also removed the middle function and added a little commentary
    I) I also had to change the asterisks in the game
    J) I also made sure to change only the asterisk's ypos not redefine the whole thing
    K) I made sure to split up space invaders 2 so that it fits mulitple documents instead of only one
